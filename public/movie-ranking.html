<h1>The Best Movies According to Michael</h1>

<h2>My top 3 movies of all time.</h2>

<hr /> 

<h3>Remember the Titans</h3>
<p>This is, by far, my favorite movie of all time. It tells a true story of a newly formed high school football team that brings an entire community together, despite all of the racial tensions of the day.</p>

<h3>Lord of the Rings Trilogy</h3>
<p>This is my favorite Christian, allegorical movie series. </p>

<h3>The Patriot</h3>
<p>This is a very inspiring telling of the American Revolution.</p>
